  <h1>Welcome to Accomplished</h1>

  <p>
  Accomplished is a small web-based application intended to help you keep track of your goals and projects from a little bit of a different perspective than a TODO application. Instead of checking off items or creating Gantt charts, Accomplished is about recording your ideas about a few long term goals and what projects you're working on now.
  </p>

  <p>
  When you finish a project, you record that and some notes. Then, later on, you can look back on your accomplishments and see the progress you've made with some neat reporting. This will be useful for knowing what projects you'd like to include in a portfolio or what you'd like to make sure is part of staff evaluations at work.
